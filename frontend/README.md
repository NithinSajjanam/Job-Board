# Frontend Overview

The frontend is a React single-page application (SPA) built using Create React App. It leverages modern React features such as hooks, context API, and functional components for efficient state management and UI rendering.

## Technologies and Libraries

- **React**: Core library for building the user interface.
- **React Router DOM**: Handles client-side routing and navigation.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **Framer Motion & GSAP**: Libraries used for smooth animations and transitions.
- **React Icons**: Provides a wide range of icons used throughout the UI.
- **React Calendar**: Used for calendar views and scheduling features.
- **Context API**: Manages global state such as authentication and UI state.
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulate reusable logic like authentication status.
